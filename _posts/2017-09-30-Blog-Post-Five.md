**WHAT DID YOU DO THIS PAST WEEK?** Generally my schedule this week was similar to last week's, the main difference being that the first SWE project was due Thursday night. We had a last minute change in our project idea, which was slightly stressful, but I'm glad that we did because there were too many problems we were having with the APIs we were planning on using for our travel website. Now we're a national parks database! I think our website meets all the requirements, the only weird thing that we haven't figured out is why our domain from namecheap occassionally points back to the ghost/placeholder website.

**WHAT'S IN YOUR WAY?** I'm missing most of next week due to Grace Hopper so I'm worried about how it will affect team projects like Game Tech class where part of the project is due the upcoming week. Missing last Friday's class lead to me being unprepared for the quiz the following Monday and I got a 0. :( Trying to prevent this from happening again these upcoming weeks!

**WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?** This upcoming week I'm going to Grace Hopper and will be doing some work while there to stay up-to-date with everything.

**WHAT'S MY EXPERIENCE OF THE CLASS?** Class is more 101-python so far and not so much software engineering yet, but it's been pretty interesting learning about python. It has some really weird aspects!

**PICK/TIP OF THE WEEK?:** For those trying to stay on-track for interviews, Leetcode has been doing these [weekly weekend virtual competitions](https://leetcode.com/contest/). If you're too lazy to look up questions and would prefer to get few random questions regularly to brush up on CS topics when you are free, I would totally recommend trying them out! Or at the very least just reading the questions and seeing solutions people post!
