title: Week 6!
---


**WHAT DID YOU DO THIS PAST WEEK?** The material of the week was focused on getting some of the inner-workings of software contracts and the various types of iterators. Though I appreciate the detail that we go over things in class, I still feel like I'm missing some parts that I definitely need to review over for the exam. This has been clearly visible with my sad quiz grades that I need to work hard to get up. Outside of OOP, last week was hell for me with exams and all the work that I had to do.

**WHAT'S IN YOUR WAY?** I'm starting to feel a little burned out by the semester already and I just want everything to end (sad really that it's barely been two months since the semester started). I'm starting to feel I should be sleeping less and spending more time working now that I've gotten over my cold. Other then that I have an interview coming up on Tuesday that I also need to focus on and some other random coursework that isn't necessary hard but eats up a lot of time.

**WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?** During the weekend I started glancing over material that is going to be covered on the exam coming up on Thursday. I still don't know my material well enough so I'm going to continue reviewing throughout the week until the exam. I'm worried about what the exam will be like, I know that it's going to be a lot of coding but I'm unsure how to study for it successfully... 

**PICK/TIP OF THE WEEK?** One thing I've recently started doing reall often is ssh-ing into the computer lab, especially when things get late and I still have CS312 assignments to grade and it would take too much precious time to go to the lab directly. As a result, I've done a lot of moving files back and forth between the lab and my own laptop and have been getting pretty good at using scp. scp allows you to quickly transfer data remotely to locally or vice-versa. The syntax is pretty easy and is extremely convienent when you forget to upload your files to some cloud storage system and need access to your data. While I've finally gotten down the syntax for using scp, here's a [link](http://www.hypexr.org/linux_scp_help.php) that I always referenced. The examples are all super simple and easy to understand with no extra fluff. Oh, and moving folders through scp is the same as moving a file, all you have to do is add the flag -r after scp. For instance, if you need to move a folder from lab (remote) to local (own computer) just do: scp -r your_username@remotehost.edu:foobar.txt /some/local/directory.
