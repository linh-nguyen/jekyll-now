**WHAT DID YOU DO THIS PAST WEEK?** The main event this past week was SWE exam. For whatever reason I froze up during the exam and made stupid mistakes (for example: using bit shift when I could have just used divide and modulus). Other than that the overall routine has been the same.

**WHAT'S IN YOUR WAY?** Things will be calming down after this week, so I'll have more time to stay on track and get back to my usual pace of work instead of doing everything last minute.

**WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?** This next week will be focused on working on projects (IDB2, Game Tech, Big Data) and studying for upcoming midterms. I'm also planning on catching up on my online finance class since it's been sitting in the backburner for too long now. Also hoping to find the time to workout regularly.

**WHAT'S MY EXPERIENCE OF THE CLASS?** The class experience this week has been pretty normal, nothing out of the ordinary has happened. Besides the exam structure, the testing experience was similar to how it was in OOP.

**PICK/TIP OF THE WEEK?:** I recently discovered [repl.it](https://repl.it), an online compiler that can run your code through a friend. It's similar to coderpad.io, in that it allows you to write, compile and quickly run code in your browser, but better because it doesn't require payment of any sort. Before finding this tool I've been starting a new coderpad in incognito each time the 22 minutes time out. These websites allow you to choose your preferred language from a list of about 30 and give you an easy way to quickly run a piece of code without having to do the extra setup required otherwise.
