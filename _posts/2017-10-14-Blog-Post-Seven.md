**WHAT DID YOU DO THIS PAST WEEK?** The main event this past week was SWE exam. For whatever reason I froze up during the exam and made stupid mistakes (for example: using bit shift when I could have just used divide and modulus). Other than that the overall routine has been the same.

**WHAT'S IN YOUR WAY?** Things will be calming down after this week, so I'll have more time to stay on track and get back to my usual pace of work instead of doing everything last minute.

**WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?** This next week will be focused on working on group projects and studying for upcoming midterms. I'm also planning on catching up on my online finance class and finding time to workout regularly.

**WHAT'S MY EXPERIENCE OF THE CLASS?** The class experience has been pretty normal and expected, nothing out of the ordinary has happened. Besides the exam structure, the testing experience was similar to how it was in OOP.

**PICK/TIP OF THE WEEK?:** I recently discovered (repl.it)[https://repl.it], an online compiler that can run your code. It's similar to coderpad.io, but better because it doesn't require payment of any sort. You can choose whatever language you'd like to run and it's an easy way to quickly run a piece of code without having to do extra setup required otherwise.
