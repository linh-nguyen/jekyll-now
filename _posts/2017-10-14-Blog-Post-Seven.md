**WHAT DID YOU DO THIS PAST WEEK?** Main event this past week was SWE exam. For whatever reason I froze up during the exam and made stupid mistakes (for example: using bit shift when I could have just used divide and modulus).

**WHAT'S IN YOUR WAY?** Things are calming down after this week, so I'll have more time to do things. 

**WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?** This next week will be focused on working on projects for my classes and begin studying for upcoming midterms. I'm going to try to catch up on my online finance class since I've been putting a lot of it on the backburner.

**WHAT'S MY EXPERIENCE OF THE CLASS?** The class experience has been pretty normal and expected, nothing out of the ordinary has happened.

**PICK/TIP OF THE WEEK?:**
