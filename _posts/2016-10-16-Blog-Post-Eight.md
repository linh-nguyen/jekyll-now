title: Week 8!
---


**WHAT DID YOU DO THIS PAST WEEK?** Starting coding for project 3, Allocator, with my partner. We coded a lot and then realized we did stupid mistakes that were causing us to fail. I'm glad that valid was one of the first things we wrote because it helped catch logic erros in allocate and deallocate! As long as things go well after testing then we've finished writing all the code and will only have clean-up left. In class we spent time talking about the project and going in-detail about how allcator works differently for built-in types vs user-types. Most interesting tidbit I learned was about the undefined behavior that occurs going passed the bounds of an array is because sometimes the OS has to give you more space than necessary.

**WHAT'S IN YOUR WAY?** Grace Hopper. As much as I am very excited to attend and am looking forward to it, I'm going to miss half of the week... Not something that will help me in catching up when I'm still so behind in everything. :( Finishing the project before leaving is important too, since we're both not going to be attending and it would be hard to coordinate otherwise.

**WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?** It would be highly preferable that the project is finished by Tuesday night since I will be away for Grace Hopper from Wednesday - Friday, so we're going to work on finishing the project before then. Besides that there's making the most out of Grace Hopper and doing some more catch-up for all my classes.

**PICK/TIP OF THE WEEK?** Ever have a really long file name you're trying to delete or copy or move that you wish you could shorthand in terminal instead of letting tab complete fill the line in with a long name? Or have multiple files you want to delete in terminal that have similar names? Either way, one cool thing is the use of the wild card character * that you can match with anything. So if you have a file called "abc abbc alkds ksie alks.txt" that you want to delete you could just do $rm abc*. Alternatively, if you have these files you want to delete: hw1, hw2, hw3, etc. You could just do the command $rm hw* and it will remove all files that begin with hw! You can also include the wild card in the middle of something too!
