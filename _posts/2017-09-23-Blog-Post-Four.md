**WHAT DID YOU DO THIS PAST WEEK?** The big events last week were my chemistry exam and onsite. The exam went alright, I should have studied more and went to the review, but it's good to note for next time. My onsite was in Seattle so I stayed most of the weekend to explore the city. So far Austin or Seattle are front-runners for where I would want to go for full-time. The vibes of both cities are similar, though Seattle has much better weather.

**WHAT'S IN YOUR WAY?** Time is in my way. I feel like I never have enough time to finish everything or that it passes too quickly for me to get much done. Besides that I'm missing quite a bit of class so I need to make sure to stay updated and on track.

**WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?** Playing catch-up on everything I haven't finished and/or missed. Unfortunately I wasn't able to completely finish the Big Data or Game Tech projects before leaving, so I need to finish those before Tuesday. Between then I need to do more prep for the interviews and find time to catch up on and finish Project 2 for this class. 

**PICK/TIP OF THE WEEK?:** Recently I was stuck in an elevator between the 2nd and 3rd floor of my apartment and realized that I had no clue what the protocol was when the call button doesn't work. If you ever get stuck in an elevator and the call button doesn't work, just call 911. It is a valid emergency and the fastest way to get out. We weren't sure if it was, so were stuck in the elevator for 30-40 minutes as our call was routed around. Additionally, always have your cell phone with you. I almost didn't bring mine, thinking it would be a short trip downstairs to grab the mail. I was lucky someone else was in the elevator with me, but if I had gotten stuck in the elevator alone there wouldn't have been a way for me to call for help.
