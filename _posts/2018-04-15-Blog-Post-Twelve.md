title: The Role of AI

The construction industry has been one of the slowest to adopt technology. However, as the struggle to find skilled labor in the industry has increased, investors are putting more money into start-ups that are hoping to create robots to make construction safer, faster, and cheaper. One of these start-ups is called Construction Robotics and they created SAM (Semi-Automated Mason), a robot that can lay down three-thousand bricks in only eight hours. The robot cannot do it all himself, however, and requires humans to load the machine up properly before SAM can start working. While workers in other industries like manufacturing have seen robots and technology as a threat to their job security, those in construction do not feel the same way. Workers see the new machines as decreasing the physical burden that comes with the job instead. I believe that robots are not yet considered a threat because of the current shortage of skilled labor in construction and the fact that the robots are still pretty rudimentary.

I believe that there's a possibility that as robots are introduced into construction, more people might start to join the industry as it requires less physical exertion to take on the job. And after a certain point, down the line, I am sure that the workers in the industry will feel differently and feel threatened that AI is here. With all technology, things start up simple but can improve very fast. It's pretty interesting to see how tech is growing in areas it hasn't been thought to exist in before and what changes it is making.
