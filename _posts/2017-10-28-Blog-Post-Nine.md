**WHAT DID YOU DO THIS PAST WEEK?** IDB2 was due and I had my chemistry exam. We started the project much later than last time and could definitely feel the regrets when missing on social meetings the Thursday it was due. I feel like there are certain aspects that could have been much cleaner, however, overall I think we met the bare minimum requirements. This upcoming project I definitely want to get started earlier and have the entire group meet up to work. I feel like there was unnecessarily slowing added overhead with parts of the group not meeting in person to work and debug instead of trying through slack communication debug on slack.

**WHAT'S IN YOUR WAY?** I don't have a lot of presssing assignments due this week, so I have a little more time. My only issues are for Big Data, there's an exam on Tuesday and a project due Thursday morning.

**WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?** Studying the concepts for Big Data, starting initial work for IDB3, finishing the big data project, catching up on Chemistry, doing my online finance class, and finding time to go to the gym.

**WHAT'S MY EXPERIENCE OF THE CLASS?** It feels like we are transitioning from Python 101 to SQL 101. Having taken data management, I feel like a lot of this is just things I've already learned so it's less stressful for class for me.

**PICK/TIP OF THE WEEK?:**
