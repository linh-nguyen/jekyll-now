**WHAT DID YOU DO THIS PAST WEEK?** IDB2 was due and I had my chemistry exam. We started the project much later than the last and I definitely felt the regrets when I had to miss events happening on Thursday to finish. I feel like there are certain aspects that could have been much cleaner, however, overall we met the bare minimum requirements.

**WHAT'S IN YOUR WAY?** There aren't a lot of presssing assignments due this week, so I have a little more time. My only issues are the big data midterm on Tuesday and big data project due Thursday morning.

**WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?** Studying the concepts for big data. I need a lot of review on the details, I can code it but I haven't been paying attention to the underlying basis. Hopefully my group will start the initial work for IDB3 just so we aren't rushing the last final minutes to get everything done. Other than that I have to finish the big data project, catch up on Chemistry, do my online finance class, and find time to go to the gym.

**WHAT'S MY EXPERIENCE OF THE CLASS?** It feels like we are taking a break from python and focusing a lot on SQL. Having taken data management, I feel like a lot of this is review so it's helped made the class a little less stressful.

**PICK/TIP OF THE WEEK?:** My tip of the week revolves around SQL. I feel like SQL is mainly memorization but still can be hard to think about since it's so different from languages like Java. When I took data management I found (this)[http://www.sqltutorial.org/sql-cheat-sheet/] SQL cheatsheet super useful. It has most of what you could ever need from SQL on it in an easy to read format.
