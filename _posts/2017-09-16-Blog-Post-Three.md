**WHAT DID YOU DO THIS PAST WEEK?** I was able to get caught up on most of my work last week and finished both the SWE and Big Data projects. I'm not as ahead as I would want to be, but at least I'm not behind. The pomodoro technique seems to be working better than my old schedule so I'm going to keep going with it.

**WHAT'S IN YOUR WAY?** I'll be missing the next two Friday classes due to onsites and then Wednesday - Friday the week after due to Grace Hopper. I'm hoping I won't be too far behind when I get back.

**WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?** This week I'm going to study up for my exam on Thursday, while finishing up the Big Data and Game Tech projects before I leave Thursday night. I will try to start doing my online class, I've been pushing it back because there are no strict due dates... I can feel the sleepless weeks coming. :'(

**WHAT'S MY EXPERIENCE OF THE CLASS?** The readings are much longer than I remember, I need to start earlier than I have been on them. Besides that, everything has been pretty chill so far and continuing as normal. I've noticed that the workflow has been updated quite a bit since when I took OOP. A lot of it felt unnecessary for such a small scale project, but I can see how the flow mimics more like out in the industry.

**PICK/TIP OF THE WEEK?:** This week someone taught me a super useful tool in vim: using macros. Macros let you record a series of steps and bind them to a key. Then you can just press the key and it will repeat everything you just recorded. It can really speed things up if you are doing the same monotonous task, over and over again. Here's a [nice tutorial](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2009/01/vi-and-vim-macro-tutorial-how-to-record-and-play) for macros if you are interested!
