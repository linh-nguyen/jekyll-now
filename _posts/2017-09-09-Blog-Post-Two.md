**WHAT DID YOU DO THIS PAST WEEK?** Trying to settle into school again, getting a taste of lacking sleep, and regretting not starting on work earlier, and regretting not going to the football game. I spent a couple hours writing down all my due dates/exams for classes and putting them on my calendar. I'm determined to stay on track and get organized this semester. I did some running. I realized I need to organize my inbox and decide if I want to do more full-time interviews and risk missing more class or not. I already know I'm missing 3 SWE classes, one for an interview and two for Grace Hopper.

**WHAT'S IN YOUR WAY?** My dimly lit apartment. It's so dimly lit. It's so sad. The apartment is facing the patio and it gets barely any sunlight. Having windows just makes me more depressed because there is no sun for me. It's always a shocker going outside again because of how starkly bright it is. I can't study at the apartment. I must find a good place to study at outside that isn't GDC either because seeing people I know distracts me. Besides that, getting organized. Trying to catch up and remind myself that yes I do have an online class. And yes while the online class has no set due dates I need to stay on track or risk derailing my semester. 

**WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?** I'm going to spend the rest of today catching up on all my work and getting back up to speed. I'm organizing my things

**WHAT'S MY EXPERIENCE OF THE CLASS?** Class has been as expected. I did forget how slow-moving the class was. Not that I hate it too much, I'm more excited to get to the nitty gritty details of Python and understand the language more. Was cold-called last week but it wasn't too bad (got easy questions though). I realized how much I still need to work on being more confident in my answers and less meek about what I should be saying. I still get highly nervous, but really how many people even care when you're busy stressing anyways?

**PICK/TIP OF THE WEEK?:**
