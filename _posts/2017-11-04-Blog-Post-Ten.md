**WHAT DID YOU DO THIS PAST WEEK?** The Under Armour talk was interesting and super long. It's interesting seeing the different technology stack and approaches different companies take. Registration was this week, it was the first time that things went so smoothly for me. Yay for senior year: every class was open and I was able to get into all the classes I wanted. I'm really excited for next semester!

**WHAT'S IN YOUR WAY?** Nothing much, I just need to make sure I don't let my procrastination get any worse than it already is.

**WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?** I keep saying this, but I really do need to do work for my online finance class. Everything is due in a month and I've barely done anything for it... Will also be working on finishing up the IDB project due this Thursday. Hopefully we'll be able to wrap things up by Wednesday so that I can go to an event Thursday evening. Last time I had to skip to finish up the project. :(

**WHAT'S MY EXPERIENCE OF THE CLASS?** Learning about regular expressions has been super useful. It's something I've been meaning to learn about for a while but was always discouraged by how complicated it looked. I wasn't ever able to find an easy to understand guide either so that didn't help. Downing made it easy and simple to understand by going over the main components and then some useful methods.

**PICK/TIP OF THE WEEK?:** I worked on some sorting on the frontend and it's a lot simpler to implement than I thought it would be.
