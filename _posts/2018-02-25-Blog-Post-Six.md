A misunderstanding surrounding net neutrality is that without these rules the telecom giants will be able to do as they want to and no rules will control them. This is untrue, however, because there are already current rules in place that are preventing them from doing so. There is a lot of wrong information circulating online about what net neutrality is and isn't and this can be very dangerous for the average user who relies on sources like Facebook for information. This myth in particular would likely influence the general populace to favor passing net neutrality in order to prevent the companies from having so much freedom. And while I do support net neutrality, I do think that having people vote for the wrong reasons is terrible because having incorrect knowledge will have wider negative impact on other issues as well. People need to stop believing everything they see on the internet and as someone who is better-versed than most as a computer scientist, it is important to spread awareness of this fact. I believe, as computer scientists, it is important to be knowledgeable in topics that influence tech like net neutrality does. This is because people are bound to take our opinion more seriously because our jobs relate to computers and the internet. So if we are not educated, than what we say could potentially spread misinformation. I think it's important that computer scientists read up on and have a basic understanding of what net neutrality is and be willing to answer questions and correct those who are misunderstanding the issue. If each of us does this simple thing, it can have wide effects and hopefully help everyone become more informed.
