What are some of the misunderstandings related to the Internet and its functionality, and how do these influence the general populace's opinion (and understanding) of net neutrality and its impact? What are some ways we as computer scientists can help spread understandable, accurate information?

There's the misunderstanding that ISPs (Internet Service Providers) are tracking all page requests and are watching what everyone does on the internet. However, this is not true. ISPs do have the power to, but it does not benefit them to spend all their time and money to track everyone. This belief can make people fearful of the internet and plays into the misunderstanding that net neutrality is required to help govern the ISPs or else these telecom giants will be able to do what they please with no rules to control them. This belief is completely wrong because there are already rules in place that regulate them. 

There is a lot of wrong information circulating online about what net neutrality is and isn't and this can be very dangerous for the average user who relies on sources like Facebook for information. This myth in particular would likely influence the general populace to favor passing net neutrality to help regulate the ISPs power. However, while I do support passing net neutrality, I don't believe in people voting for the wrong reasons. Everyone should be well-informed and make decisions based on the truth of what they believe in. People need to stop believing everything they see on the internet and not fall for these scare-tactics to push them in a certain direction.

As someone who has a better grasp of how the internet and computers work, I believe it is important for computer scientists to be knowledgeable in topics surrounding tech like net neutrality. People are likely to take our opinion more seriously because our job relates to computers and the interent. So if we are not educated, than what we say could potentially spread misinformation. I think it's important that computer scientists read up on and have a basic understanding of what net neutrality is and be willing to answer questions and correct those who are misunderstanding the issue when it comes up. If everyone even helps one person understand net neutrality better, it can have rippling effects and hopefully help everyone become more informed.
