**WHAT DID YOU DO THIS PAST WEEK?** This past week I did some more studying for the OOP exam and then took the exam last Thursday. The morning after the exam I woke up and realized I did something completely stupid on questions 1 and 2 of the exam which likely cost me most of the points if not all. Oops is an understatement. I really regret how I approached the exam and I really should change my recent attitude towards my grades. On a brighter note I went to ACL and that is going fun.

**WHAT'S IN YOUR WAY?** As much as I've tried to convince myself this semester that I've worked really hard, my work ethic this semester has been almost non-existent. These past two exams week have been bad and when I get a terrible grade now I'm not really sad, I just expect it. I think I've started to really wonder if CS is for me at this point or if I want to stay in the major and my motivation has plummented as a result... Either way, I need to step up my A-game if I want to salvage my grades. Hopefully I'm able to turn things around! The only thing getting in the way of my plan is that I will miss practically the entire week of October 17th due to an onsite on Monday and Grace Hopper on Wednesday-Friday.  

**WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?** I already have a partner for project 3 so hopefully we can start on it this week and figure things out and finish ASAP. I'm going to start staying on track for OOP and go back to read things I missed. Also catching up in all my other classes is a must.

**PICK/TIP OF THE WEEK?** If you're a vim user I'd highly recommend adding things to your .vimrc file to allow for a better experience! Here is a [cool site](https://www.cs.oberlin.edu/~kuperman/help/vim/home.html) of things you can add to customize your vim and hopefully make things easier. My favorite from the list include "set number" and "set mouse=a". The first allows you to see line numbers in vim and the second allows you to use a mouse click to move your cursor where you want in vim.
