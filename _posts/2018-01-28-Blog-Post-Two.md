Tolstoy's short story "How Much Land Does A Man Need?" focuses on greed and the question of when enough is enough. The main character is a peasant farmer, Pahom, who argues that being a farmer is more moral and supports the best lifestyle as long as the farmer has enough land, that a farmer does not have the time to fall to the sins of greed. In the end, however, we see Pahom succumb to an insatiable desire for more land that ends up killing him.

The story opens with Pahom's sister-in-law coming to visit and arguing with his wife about who lives the better life: the sister married to a farmer (Paham) or the sister married to a tradesman who lives in the city. The sister-in-law argues that she lives a better life because she has more money and free time to spend on luxury goods. Pahom's wife argues that excess comes with too high a cost (extra anxiety, stress). At this point, Pahom jumps in to say that farming is a wholesome job that does not allow for any sinful distractions, that the only issue farmers face is having enough land. The Devil hears this and plots Pahom's downfall.

As time goes on, Pahom begins to do whatever he can to gain more land and seizes any opportunity he hears. Pahom begins to become greedier and greedier as he hears of better, far-off places, taking on more and more debt, moving his family multiple times as he becomes dissatisifed. Pahom constantly wants more. His greed knows no bounds. Eventually, he ends up with a deal that would allow him take as much land as he wants, however, he must section off the entire plot in one day. If he fails to return in time, all his money will be lost. Pahom comes up with a detailed plan, however, as he sees the bountiful land he becomes greedy for more and strays from his plan as he tries to take more. Near the end Pahom uses up all his strength to get back in time, and while he does make it back, he ends up dying. His greed killed him and all his work was for nothing. If Pahom had been satisifed much earlier on, he would have, in the long run, built up a large amount of wealth and lived to see the fruits of his labor.

Tolstoy likely chose to focus on the downfall of the overly ambitious Pahom to warn the reader about the blurred line of when enough is enough. Pahom could have stopped at any time before and would have lived. There was no definite point in the story that explicitly told Pahom when to stop, just as there is nothing in life that can warn us when we are going too far. The moral is that while it is fine to continue to strive for more, eventually we need to be satisifed with what we have.
