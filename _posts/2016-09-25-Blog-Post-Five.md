**WHAT DID YOU DO THIS PAST WEEK?** This past week my partner and I finished up working on Netflix. Halfway through we realized we weren't in github classroom, so we had to go through the effort of copying everything, commit-by-commit from the old repo into the new classroom repo. Moving over everything wasn't too bad, but there was the whole back-up of Travis CL builds so sadly our Travis integration ended up getting messed up. Overall everything ended up okay and the project was finished on time! Other than that a notable thing that happened was on Wednesday a JPL speaker came and talked about the company, how to write good software, as well as showed us a demo of the AR Mars HoloLens. The talk was really cool, the demo especially. It's crazy to think of how fast technology is accelerating and improving the in AR and VR worlds especially!

**WHAT'S IN YOUR WAY?** Upcoming week I have a lot of exams coming up, so finding a good balance between studying for those and the reading catch-up for OOP will be a challenge. I'm hoping to get as much done this weekend as possible so I can begin spacing studying for the OOP exam in the week after next.

**WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?** Studying all week for both Algo and English and then starting to review OOP material. One thing I'll definitely have to look more into is when to use the different types of iterators like how we've been doing. I feel like I'm missing something about when to choose which iterator, hopefully catching up on the reading will help me gain a better understanding!

**PICK/TIP OF THE WEEK?** If you have any Yahoo accounts would highly recommend changing your passwords ASAP and maybe your security questions and answers to be safe! Half a million account data was stolen, so it's likely for Yahoo information could be in it too. Read more [here](https://www.cnet.com/news/yahoo-500-million-accounts-hacked-data-breach/)! And if you use the same password somewhere else too, I'd go through and change those as well just to  make sure you're extra safe.
