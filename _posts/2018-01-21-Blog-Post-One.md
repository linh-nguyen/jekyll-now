title: Understanding Systems of Ethics

Duty-based or deontological ethics is based entirely on intent rather than the consequences of an action. Because of it's simplicity, this type of ethics has been around for a very long time in many forms. This code is associated with the philosopher Immanuel Kant's categorical imperative which says we should act in the ways which would expect all rational beings to act. This is not a set of hard rules to follow, but more of a way to determine if an action is moral or not. Those who follow this ethical code will do the "right" thing even if people get hurt at the end. A very common example is the Golden Rule, "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” This rule tends to generally work well in situations where the majority can agree on, for instance, not killing someone else because you don't want to be murdered. However, this fails when looking at more controversial issues like abortion because what you want doesn't necessarily line up with what someone else would want in the same situation. Duty-based ethics is easy to understand because it focuses in good will and good intent to determine what is moral. However, in comparison to the more abstract consequentialist theories, duty-based can be seen as wrong when many people get hurt as a result of a good intention. For instance, if someone did something they thought was good, but it ended up killing your entire family, it would still be hard for you to accept that what the other person did was acceptable.
