**WHAT ARE YOUR EXPECTATIONS OF THE CLASS?** While some things seem to have changed, I'm expecting it to be similar to how OOP was structured. I expect to learn about how python works and how to approach software development. I've never had any previous experience in Python and I haven't built a web application from top to bottom before so I'm excited for the semester to come!

**WHAT DID YOU DO THIS PAST WEEK?** I moved into my apartment and did some interviewing while getting ready for classes. This weekend I went to the football game. It's been nice having a slower start to ease into the semester.

**WHAT'S IN YOUR WAY?** I need to manage my time well and ensure I stay on track as the semester progresses especially with full-time interviews. One part I'm slightly worried about is that I don't have any prior knowledge of python or most of the tools we are using outside of those shared with OOP.

**WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?** I'm going to make sure I get the setup ready for class and look into the basic structure of python. I need to make sure I read all of the requirements before classes begin and do all the pre-work required. Also at the top of my priority list is getting in as much sleep as I can while I can.

**WHAT'S MY EXPERIENCE OF THE CLASS?** So far class has been as expected. The only surprise is that group assignments are now random. I'm excited to experience another Downing class because of how we are randomly called in class to answer questions, I think it helps me learn how to think on the spot.

**PICK/TIP OF THE WEEK?** This summer I was exposed to Java 8 streams. I think they are very cool and useful because they simplify code in places where you would need foreach, mapping, and filters. I used [this website](https://www.mkyong.com/java8/java-8-streams-filter-examples/) a lot to get examples of how to write streams. The examples are very simple and helped me quickly understand and piece together how to implement more complex streams.
