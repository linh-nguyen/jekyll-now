(1) Quality Assurance
(2) Testing software

Write a short (250-500 word) blog post on one or two practices/procedures a software company should use to prevent bugs in their products. This exercise is to help you think about how you might approach this problem at a job or on your personal projects, so feel free to approach it very generally, or very specifically if you have a particular industry/application in mind.
Regardless of your approach, you should explain what the practice/procedure is, how a team could use it, how it will address this problem, and any of its limitations.
