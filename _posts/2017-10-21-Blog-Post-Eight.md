**WHAT DID YOU DO THIS PAST WEEK?** This past week was pretty standard. I went to the Goldman Sachs talk on Wednesday and it was a lot less technically focused than the Atlassian talk but not in a bad way. I also went home for the weekend to visit my parents so that was nice.

**WHAT'S IN YOUR WAY?** The grind returns with a Chemistry exam on Tuesday that I desperately need to study for. I didn’t do well on the last one due to poor planning, so I’m hoping to do better this time around.

**WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?** There’s a project due for all of my CS classes this week. On Monday Game Tech milestone is due, it’s mainly an outline of the plan for the project so I’m hoping this will be done as painlessly and quickly as possible. Big Data assignment 7 is due Tuesday (same day as my Chem exam) and I’ve gotten most of it done so far. I’m planning to go to office hours on Monday to wrap things up. Lastly the SWE project needs to finished by Thursday. I’m optimistic that things will go well even though there’s quite a bit to finish up.

**WHAT'S MY EXPERIENCE OF THE CLASS?** Most of this week has been focused on how to implement certain SQL statements in Python. I’ve never thought about doing this in another language but the code for it in Python is surprisingly simple. I realized that I have a hard time connecting the individual parts we go over in class into code. I understand each concept individually but when it comes to putting it together to solve a problem I freeze up. This definitely happened during the last exam so I’m going to try to write more python code outside of class so it comes more naturally.

**PICK/TIP OF THE WEEK?:** Lately I’ve been trying to get organized and not forget to do important things. I’d recommend that if you don’t use email filtering to start doing so, it really helps ensure that you don’t accidentally miss anything and nothing gets buried in your inbox. Besides that, if you don’t already use some sort of calendar app to track events, I’d recommend doing so too because it helps send reminders so you won’t forget important things. It’s also nice to break up events into different calendars based on type.

I used to not use any type of filtering in my inbox and the only filtering that happened was the auto-filtering provided by Gmail with the Primary, Social, and Promotions folders. Now I make sure that if I expect a large number or important emails from someone, I create a filter and route it to a specific folder. This way I can immediately see a notification and these emails don’t get covered up by other unimportant ones. 

As I began using my Google Calendar more to track everything I needed to do, it became harder and harder to find what I needed to on the iPhone app because of all the clutter. The screen just wasn't big enough to see everything easily like it was on a desktop. Then I realized that you could create separate calendars and I used this to separate my events by type. For instance I now have one for my classes, one for assignments, one for exercise, and one for all other general things like tech talks/social things I have planned. This way I can choose which calendars to look at and not have to be bombarded by so many things at once.
