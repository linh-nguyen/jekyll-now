According to the Worldwatch Institute, the US is less than five percent of the global population but uses about a quarter of the worlds fossil fuel resources. The usage amount has been increasing over the years. This is a staggering amount and it shows how wasteful we are in comparison to other countries. At the same time, however, it also means that it is possible for other countries that are the developing stages to reach a point where they too will spend just as much as us. This is bad because there are limited resources on the planet, if every country becomes as consumption-heavy as the United States, there would be no way that we have enough resources for everything. Even if we depleted the entire Earth's resources, it still wouldn't be enough. This just shows how important it is that we find ways to alternative energy and use them more. We need to transition out of a country that so heavily relies on fossil fuels and move towards green energy. Otherwise, if other countries begin to advance to clean energy but we do not, then we will lag behind them in terms of development in the long run. If we want to keep our strong global presence we should adapt and learn how to save. Otherwise, we will and are contributing to the end of the world by exhausting so many resources for such a small population. We need to take example from the other countries that are more efficient and make the United States efficient as well.
