According to the Worldwatch Institute, the US is less than five percent of the global population but uses about a quarter of the world's fossil fuel resources. This is a staggering amount and shows just how excessive we are in comparison to other countries. For the most part, it is only recently that China has surpassed us in consumption in some areas, but their population far exceeds ours. Per capita we use a lot more energy than most of the world. We need to move toward alternative methods because this usage is not sustainable in the long run. From another viewpoint, if all developing countries consumed these resources at the same rate as the US, we would be depleted of resources in no time at all. We only have a limited amount of fossil fuels so it is vital that we continue to transition to more alternative sources of energy. We need to also stop being so wasteful in our usage as well. Otherwise, as other countries begin to advance to clean technology, we will fall behind in the long run. Our technology will also lag behind in development in comparison. If we want to keep our strong global presence we need to adapt. Otherwise, we are contributing to the end by exhausting so many resources for such a small population. If we want to keep this planet alive for future generations, we need to start being more aware of what we consume. We need to take example from the other countries that are more efficient in using clean energy and apply what they did to make the United States efficient as well.
