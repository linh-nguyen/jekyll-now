**WHAT DID YOU DO THIS PAST WEEK?** Worked on another big data project and sorting out what I have to do to catch up. Most of the week was spent at Grace Hopper attending the career fair and going to the panels and talks. I met up with quite a few people I knew from the summer so that was a lot of fun.

**WHAT'S IN YOUR WAY?** Missing Wednesday - Friday is going to be a lot of catch-up, especially when I have two exams this upcoming week. Balancing time, as always, will be the main issue. I need to make sure I stay on track to get everything done.

**WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?** I'll be meeting up with my Game Tech group to work on the project. There's a milestone coming up so I will need to catch-up and contribute for everything I missed. There's a Chemistry exam on Tuesday that I need to study for, I don't remember everything very well so I have a lot of cramming to do. SWE exam is Thursday so I gotta prepare for that too, not sure what to expect though. I think things have changed from when I took OOP because it's multiple choice now.

**WHAT'S MY EXPERIENCE OF THE CLASS?** I was only there for Monday's class and class has been pretty much the same. Still learning the peculiarities of python. There isn't as much strange details as in C++ though, so it's less confusing than OOP was.

**PICK/TIP OF THE WEEK?:** On the last project I realized that none of my commits were getting counted, I wasn't listed as a contributer either. It turned out that my commits were being added under my CS email and under an anonymous github email. While adding my CS email to my list of emails for github added those commits under my contribution list, it wasn't possible to with the anonymous email. In order to get it to work, I had to change go through all the commits and change the history so that all of the anonymous emails were set to my public github email.
