**WHAT DID YOU DO THIS PAST WEEK?** Big Data, Game Tech, and SWE projects were all due this past week. The first two went smoothly and were finished quickly. However, SWE was pretty stressful because we n't specfically know where we went wrong from IDB2. It's hard to focus efforts on improving if you don't know exactly where didyou failed. It might seem obvious to the graders, but if you didn't think it was wrong, it's hard to figure things out. When one of my group members asked, we weren't given anything helpful to help us pinpoint what was wrong and was given a quote from the rubric. It would have been nice if we could have gotten some more specific comments. We definitely tried to improve on where we thought we missed points on, but I'm not entirely sure if we focused our efforts in the right places. On a brighter note, I went to see the Journey LIVE performance with the Fifth House Ensemble and that was pretty fun.

**WHAT'S IN YOUR WAY?** There's another chemistry exam this Tuesday that I need to study for. Other than that I think the week will (hopefully) go pretty smoothly.

**WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?** I'm going to focus my efforts in studying for chemistry and then work on the big data project I have due in the first part of the week. After that I'm going to try to get ahead in some of my classes while I can.

**WHAT'S MY EXPERIENCE OF THE CLASS?** I'm glad we've taken a step away from SQL, the queries were getting very very complicated. I'm glad I wasn't called on because I didn't have enough time to think of a solution. It's nice that Downing went step-by-step on how the author recommended refactoring. While it was a little tedious, it helps see what exactly the author meant when he was breaking down and cleaning up code.

**PICK/TIP OF THE WEEK?:** I feel silly not knowing this, but I thought it might be helpful for someone else out there: use the -u flag when you want to only register changes to modified files already being tracked by github ($ git add -u). I didn't know this was a thing before and would either accidentally do -a and cry because I added in files I didn't want to track or have to manually go through and add each file individually.
