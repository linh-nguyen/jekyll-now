title: Week 11!

**WHAT DID YOU DO THIS PAST WEEK?** Last week continued to work on the Darwin project. Unfortunately, we didn't finish :( We did write all the code and got it working, it was just writing the unit tests that wasn't finished. I do feel like I've learned how to write code without making getters and setters now. It took a while for my mind to wrap around the idea, but I think I'm getting the hang of it.

**WHAT'S IN YOUR WAY?** This week I don't have much besides a lot of management to do to get ready for an exam this weekend. Other than I feel like I can get a lot of things done. I'm hopeful that this week goes well.

**WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?** Going to get started earlier this time on the project, Game of Life. I like that we're continuing to work with object-oriented concepts. I'm excited to see this transform my way of thinking so approaching things in an object-oriented manner becomes a little more normal. I like that the last two projects have also been projects I've had in 314, I'm planning to go back to see what I did back then compared to now. Other than that I'm going to continue to do make up for all my classes and make sure I get enough sleep. My goal this week is to increase my productivity. 

**PICK/TIP OF THE WEEK?** If you're interested in learning more about a topic, but you don't know where to get started, I'd reccomend checking out if they have a simple course in [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). There's a bunch of free courses you can take, both for a certificate and just for fun. I know for me, I'm interested in learning more about a bunch of random areas in CS but I really don't know where to begin. There's so much to learn and it's really helpful to at least have a starting point to get some general knowledge before diving deeper. One thing I've always wanted to learn more about is machine learning and vision and I found this [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) that was recommended somewhere on Quora. It's also a plus that these courses are self-paced so you can learn it at your own speed and come back to it as necessary when you have free time. I've also heard it's good to have any projects you do as a result of these courses on your resume to show that you are excited about learning more.
