title: Week 11!

**WHAT DID YOU DO THIS PAST WEEK?** Last week continued to work on the Darwin project. Unfortunately, we didn't finish :( We did write all the code and got it working, it was just writing the unit tests that wasn't finished. I do feel like I've learned how to write code without making getters and setters now. It took a while for my mind to wrap around the idea, but I think I'm getting the hang of it.

**WHAT'S IN YOUR WAY?** This week I don't have much besides a lot of management to do to get ready for an exam this weekend. Other than I feel like I can get a lot of things done. I'm hopeful that this week goes well.

**WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?** Going to get started earlier this time on the project, Game of Life. I like that we're continuing to work with object-oriented concepts. I'm excited to see this transform my way of thinking so approaching things in an object-oriented manner becomes a little more normal. I like that the last two projects have also been projects I've had in 314, I'm planning to go back to see what I did back then compared to now. Other than that I'm going to continue to do make up for all my classes and make sure I get enough sleep and stop putting things off.

**PICK/TIP OF THE WEEK?**
