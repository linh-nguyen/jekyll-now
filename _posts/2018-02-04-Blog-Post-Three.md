Waymo V. Uber is a patent infringement and trade secrets case about self-driving cars where the plantiff is Waymo and the defendent is Uber. The ruling begins February 5th, 2018. The allegation is that Uber is using patented parts of Waymo's self-driving technology which Uber got from Anthony Levandowski, a former Google employee. Levandowski had "downloaded more than 14,000 confidential and proprietary files" (Korosec) before leaving to start his own company, Otto, which eventually gets acquired by Uber. Before Levandowski joined Uber, private investigations found he had "five disks of data from Google’s driverless effort and other information" (Korosec). Uber argues that their technology is significantly different from Waymo's, Uber never told Levandowski to take any of the files, and there is no proof of Google's trade secrets being used. So far, as a result of these allegations, Uber had to throw away their designs that resembled Waymo's LiDAR design (tech that uses laser light gather data and create a map of the surroundings of the car) and Levandowski was fired.

I believe in this case is in a grey area. Uber is in the wrong for having suspicions that Levandowski had documents from his time at Google but still hiring him and not being more thorough with checking that Levandowski had actually deleted all the documents. However, there is a limit to how much Uber can run checks on Levandowski. At a certain point Uber can only trust that Levandowski had deleted the files and would not use his former company's trade secrets. Uber can't control what Levandowski knows and does. This raises the question of how much a company is responsible for their employee's actions. In this case, I would argue that it is Levandowski who has is the most at fault, however, because he works for Uber Uber now has to take responsibility (this is assuming that Uber was not aware of and did not convince Levandowski to use Google's trade secrets).

This case really highlights the problems of hiring employees from other companies that are working on similar technologies. How long is enough time before you can hire someone and not be fearful that they will bring in old company secrets? I believe this case could result in stricter non-compete clauses and more thorough checks when employees leave a company. No company would want to have a situation like this happen and then throw away years of work based on one employee's actions that the company had virtually control over.
