Waymo V. Uber is a patent infringement and trade secrets case about self-driving cars where the plantiff is Waymo and the defendent is Uber. The ruling begins February 5th, 2018. The allegation is that Uber is using patented parts of Waymo's self-driving technology which Uber got from Anthony Levandowski, a former Google employee. Levandowski had "downloaded more than 14,000 confidential and proprietary files" before leaving to start his own company, Otto, which eventually gets acquired by Uber. When private investigations were made before Levandowski joins Uber he was found to have "five disks of data from Google’s driverless effort and other information". Uber argues that their technology is significantly different from Waymo's and that Uber never told Levandowski to take any of the files. Along the way Uber had to throw away their designs that resembled Waymo's LiDAR design (tech that uses laser light gather data and create a map of the surroundings of the car).

I believe in this case is in a grey area. Uber is in the wrong for having suspicions that Levandowski had documents from his time at Google but still hiring him and not being more thorough with checking that Levandowski had actually deleted all these documents. However, there is a limit to how much Uber can run checks on Levandowski. At a certain point Uber can only trust that Levandowski had deleted those files and would not use his former company's trade secrets while working at Uber. Uber can't control what Levandowski knows and does. This raises the question of how much a company is responsible for their employee's actions. Like in this case I would argue that it is Levandowski who has the most faults and should be the one that gets sued, however, because he works for Uber Uber now has to take responsibility.

This case really highlights the problems of hiring employees from other companies that are working on similar technologies. How long is enough time before you can hire someone and not be fearful that they will bring in old company secrets?
