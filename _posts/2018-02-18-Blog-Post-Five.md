Write a short (250-500 word) blog post on what an ethical company looks like to you. You can consider factors such as the company's product, production pipeline, its culture, involvement in the community, or anything else you would want or expect. You are welcome to talk about existing companies, or company structures, but you are also free to consider how you would want to do business if you were a company founder and a role model for future entrepreneurs and developers.

Product: Helps someone in some way or does some sort of good
Production pipeline: Provides for their workers and nothing is sourced unethically. All works paid reasonably in pipeline. No exploitation of workers in factories or abroad or part-time
Culture: Open/transparent culture. Willing to talk to others and help each other. Not hyper competitive. Everyone feels like they belong and they can voice their opinions without fear. Considerate.
Involvement in community: involvement in some way. Some volunteer days. if company really big then donations to community. paying all their taxes and not trying to evade. willing to participate in community events as a sponsor.
