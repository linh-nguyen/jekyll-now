Write a short (250-500 word) blog post on what an ethical company looks like to you. You can consider factors such as the company's product, production pipeline, its culture, involvement in the community, or anything else you would want or expect. You are welcome to talk about existing companies, or company structures, but you are also free to consider how you would want to do business if you were a company founder and a role model for future entrepreneurs and developers.
