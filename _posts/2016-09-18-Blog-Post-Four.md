title: Week 4!
---


**WHAT DID YOU DO THIS PAST WEEK?** This past week project 2, Netflix, was released and my partner and I began coding it. When we were first told in class that there was no starter code, I was terrified. Having rarely started a project completely from scratch, it was intimidating to think about having to come up with everything. However, once we started breaking the project specs up and doing it bit-by-bit, things turned out (so far) to be pretty simple. On Wednesday, a speaker came in who talked about his time at Bloomberg, Chris Martin. The Bloomberg talk was pretty interesting and really made me think more about considering trying to intern at a company that isn't like Google/Facebook/MS.

**WHAT'S IN YOUR WAY?** Life is in the way. There's so much stuff going on right now with career fair right around the corner that it's super stressful and hard to balance everything succesfully. I have a backlog of things to read, including OOP, that I need to catch up on. I really need to get on things or else the upcoming OOP quizes could go very, very badly (which I really can't have happen at this point).

**WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?** In this upcoming week I hope to finish Netflix before the deadline and successfully turn it in, ideally with an RMSE that is below 0.95 if things go as planned. Other than that I plan to catch up on reading, go to career fair, and do well on the interviews I have scheduled for next week.

**PICK/TIP OF THE WEEK?** With career fair coming up, the best time to go would be during the start of career fair (1PM) when there's less people there and shorter lines for all the big companies that everyone wants to talk to. Even if you don't want to attend the career fair itself, I would highly reccomend volunteering if you can! I did it my freshman year and it was defintely worth it because I still got to talk to some of the recruiters and networked.

Side note on tip of the week: With iOS 10 released, there's a lot of cool (and useless) features that were added. The best features were FINALLY being able to delete the terrible Apple apps (mainly Apple maps) and the sticker function on messages (download sticker packs from the app store and you can pin them to your/others messages)!
