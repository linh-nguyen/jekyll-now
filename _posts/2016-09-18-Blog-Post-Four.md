title: Week 4!
---


**WHAT DID YOU DO THIS PAST WEEK?** This past week project 2, Netflix, was released and my partner and I began coding it. When we were first told in class that there was no starter code, I was terrified. Having rarely started a project completely from scratch, it was intimidating to think about having to come up with everything. However, once we started breaking the project specs up and doing it bit-by-bit, things turned out (so far) to be pretty simple. On Wednesday, a speaker came in who talked about his time at Bloomberg, Chris Martin. The Bloomberg talk was pretty interesting and really made me think more about considering trying to intern at a company that isn't like Google/Facebook/MS.

**WHAT'S IN YOUR WAY?** Life is in the way. There's so much stuff going on right now with career fair right around the corner that it's super stressful and hard to balance everything succesfully. I have a backlog of things to read, including OOP, that I need to catch up on. I really need to get on things or else the upcoming OOP quizes could go very, very badly (which I really can't have happen at this point).

**WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?** In this upcoming week I hope to finish Netflix before the deadline and successfully turn it in, ideally with an RMSE that is below 0.95 if things go as planned. Other than that I plan to catch up on reading, go to career fair, and do well on the interviews I have scheduled for next week.
