**WHAT DID YOU DO THIS PAST WEEK?** Finished the Big Data assignment pretty early on Monday so I didn't have to stay up until 4am again. I had my 4th chemistry test, it went alright. Saw Thor: Ragnarok during the weekend and it was pretty good. I went with friends but I feel like I missed some of the Marvel jokes since I haven't seem all of the previous movies.

**WHAT'S IN YOUR WAY?** Not much is in my way as the break is nearing. It's more of a battle to make sure I don't forget all my responsiblities. I have to do a lot of project work over the break which is kinda sad.

**WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?** Next week is Thanksgiving! So I'm going to be spending it with family and catch up with the rest of my work!

**WHAT'S MY EXPERIENCE OF THE CLASS?** I didn't really know the specifics of dynamic binding before so going over that in class was pretty interesting for me! Besides that we went over overloading and had an ethics talk with Cline and Rich and it was really interesting! I'm pretty excited for the Contemporary Issues course next semester since I would imagine the lectures will be somewhat similar to the talk. 

**PICK/TIP OF THE WEEK?:** I found [this article](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/nov/05/computer-says-no-why-making-ais-fair-accountable-and-transparent-is-crucial) about the ethics surrounding artificial intelligence. The article talks about how pervasive AI is getting and how important it is that we become more transparent about how it works. Ethics is so important with AI because we end up leaving it to learn for itself. And if it learns bad things, bad things can happen (for example, Microsoft's chatbox AI on twitter became super racist in less than a day).
