title: Week 12!
---


**WHAT DID YOU DO THIS PAST WEEK?** This past week I continued to work with my partner on the Life project. It's confusing but pretty interesting thinking about how to approach AbstractCell and the Cell handler classes. The refinement overriding and concept of virtual classes that we discussed in class was really interesting. All the constructor quizes have been really helpful for me, I think I'm starting to get the hang of it now, which is exciting! :) Outside of OOP, I've been starting to organize and work on my other assignments due soon as the semester begins to wrap up.

**WHAT'S IN YOUR WAY?** Time, always time. The amount of methods we've been adding makes me really dread all the tests we'll have to write before turnin. I think by the end of this class I've written more tests than I have at my internship and other classes combined. I still hate writing tests, but I overall like the workflow. This week I shouldn't have any tests to worry about, which is great.

**WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?** Going to wrap up and finish the final project, work on the algorithm assignment, look into starting a side project, and begin planning out how I should start studying for finals. Oh and grading the 312 assignments really early is a goal for me, hopefully by EOD Monday have that done.

**PICK/TIP OF THE WEEK?** Tired of clicking the up button trying to find a command you entered in the commandline sometime earlier? You can do a search of your recent terminal history by typing: ctrl+r and typing in the keyword of what was contained in the command you're trying to find. Saves time and lets easily find the commands you used the otherday.
